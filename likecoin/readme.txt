With this plug-in installed in your site, every Like is a Reward.

== Description ==

LikeCoin is an infrastructure to decentralize publishing.

= Decentralized Archive =
LikeCoin plugin publishes your posts to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) through [Matters.news](https://matters.news) for peer-to-peer distribution. In the next stage, you will also be able to register your content an International Standard Content Number, [ISCN](https://iscn.io/), a specification we drafted in collaboration with the industry. Borrowed from the concept of ISBN for books, ISCN is a unique number assigned to content such as articles and images, and comes with metadata such as author, publisher, content address, license terms and creation footprint. Stored on [LikeCoin chain](https://likecoin.bigdipper.live), ISCN is immutable and censorship resilient.

= Decentralized rewards =
LikeCoin plugin attaches a [LikeCoin button](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/likecoin-button) beneath your content. Without setting up a paywall, every Like by readers is turned into measurable rewards in [LikeCoin tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/likecoin/). The [Civic Liker](https://liker.land/civic) movement encourages readers to contribute USD5/mo to reward creativity and journalism, while the matching fund, distributed according to the Likes of all users, doubles the rewarding pool. With the decentralized rewards mechanism, every Like counts.

= Decentralized Curation =
Apart from rewarding creators as a Liker, readers may go further to become a Content Jockey. Content Jockeys help distribute creative stories and insightful commentaries with Super Likes, which are purposely designed to be scarce to cut out noise from signals. When a story gets popular, LikeCoinâ€™s unique distribution footprint rewards both creator and Content Jockey, creating an all win situation for the content ecosystem.

[LikeCoin tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/likecoin/) can be exchanged into USD, TWD or cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin on exchanges such as [Liquid](https://app.liquid.com/exchange/LIKEUSDT), [DigiFinex](https://www.digifinex.com/en-ww/trade/USDT/LIKE) and [BitAsset](https://www.bitasset.com/ktrade/LIKE-TWD). Information of the LikeCoin token (LIKE) can be found in [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/likecoin/) and [Big Dipper](https://likecoin.bigdipper.live/) blockchain explorer.
