With this plug-in installed in your site, every Like is a Reward.

== Description ==

[Civic Liker](https://like.co) is a social movement to help bloggers and independent journalists make passive income by enabling Like Rewards on their websites. It can be done simply by installing this plugin.

On the Internet, rewards and creativity are decoupled. Creators producing high quality contents receive “Likes” but not income. LikeCoin Foundation aims to reinvent the Like by re-aligning creativity and reward. "Likes" are turned into rewards from the Civic Liker monthly subscriptions as well as Creators Matching Fund, and shared to all creators.

LikeCoin thus rewarded can be exchanged into USD on exchanges such as [BitAsset](https://www.bitasset.com/) and [Liquid](https://www.liquid.com/). Information of the LikeCoin token (LIKE) can be found in [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/likecoin/) and Etherscan(https://etherscan.io/token/0x02f61fd266da6e8b102d4121f5ce7b992640cf98).
